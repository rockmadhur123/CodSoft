                <h2>The Goat Of Cricket</h2>
                <p>Virat Kohli has secured more than 23,500 international runs.
                     He is also the only batsman to average 50+ in all three formats of the game.
                     He is also the highest run-scorer in the IPL with 6,283 runs.
                     One of the key attributes that make Virat Kohli a strong contender for the,
                      title of GOAT is his consistency with the bat.Sachin Tendulkar earned the moniker of 'God of Cricket'
                       for his fans while Virat Kohli gradually came to be known as the 'new God of Cricket'.</p>
